# Notes on Attachment Support:
#
# 1. Attachment Format:
#    Each attachment must be an object with:
#    - data: Base64-encoded file content (required)
#    - mimeType: MIME type like "image/jpeg", "image/png", "application/pdf" (required)
#    - filename: Optional filename for the attachment
#    - description: Optional description/alt text for accessibility
#
# 2. Platform Limitations:
#    - Mastodon: Supports multiple attachments, various file types
#    - Bluesky: Supports up to 4 images only, no other file types
#    - If both URL embeds and attachments are present, URL embeds take priority on Bluesky
#
# 3. Configuration:
#    - attachmentsKey: Specifies the JSON key containing the attachments array
#    - Can use dot notation for nested keys (e.g., "data.attachments")
#    - If attachmentsKey is not specified, no attachments will be processed
#
# 4. Error Handling:
#    - Invalid base64 data will be skipped with a warning
#    - Missing required fields (data, mimeType) will be skipped
#    - Upload failures for individual attachments won't stop the post
#
# 5. Performance Considerations:
#    - Large attachments will increase processing time
#    - Consider timeout settings for commands that generate attachments
#    - Base64 encoding increases data size by ~33%
